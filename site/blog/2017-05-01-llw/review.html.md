_If any existing deities ever wish to grant me a boon_, you muse, _it surely will be a complete effacing of the results of the mere slight chance which fixed my eye on this certain fateful stray comment_ which appeared inside what you have now started to regard as [a PR of the utmost evil][1]. It was nothing on which you would naturally have stumbled in the course of your daily round, for it was an old unmerged and forgotten PR. It had somehow escaped even the culling at the hands of the fearless Brandon with his strange and dogged insistence on separated repos. It seems he had pondered a great deal, and with alarmingly radical daring, over that striated marking in the code; reading into it certain contradictions in Nature which whetted his curiosity to the utmost, and made him avid to sink yet more split-out repos in the formation to which the fragments evidently belonged. He was oddly convinced that the marking was that of some bulky, unknown, and radically unclassifiable provider of seemingly advanced evolution... But that is a digression for another, vastly more peaceful time.

You peer closely at the code, perplexed as to why there is a PR comment that reads ```“Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn” ```. For what even could be the meaning of the queer ramblings in such completely logic-defying gibberish which you found? Had the author become credulous of even the most superficial impostures? You resolve to search out the person responsible for the eldritch knowledge necessary for this apparent disturbance of your preciously guarded peace of mind, renewed after fixing an error with the [undefined method 'get_folder_paths'][2].

The author, mysteriously enough, does not answer your desperate and repeated entreaties for help, and so you turn to the nearest warm body, the unfortunate LJ. As you describe the comment in no uncertain terms, he goes silent. Horrified, his face draining eerily of all color, he backs away slowly from your monitor, an anguished look on his face, muttering once to himself, “In his house at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.” Little do you know that poor LJ has had some recent nightmares of his own: he has been recently haunted by the dreaded override_gem, and even the valiant attempts at [updating deps to latest][3] will not soothe his shaken soul. 

You decide to take a break [here][pause].
