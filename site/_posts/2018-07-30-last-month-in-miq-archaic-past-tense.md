"My name is Ilnarin," the proud dwarf announced, "daughter of Raszaka, daughter of Ellina, daughter of Almyara, heir to the kingdom of Vik-Huzth, Queen of the Neither-Under-Nor-Over-Folk, ring-carrier, dragon-slayer, M.D., Rt Hon."

We have [added a search filter to ESX 6.7](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/17891).

We are now [consolidating option parsing to EvmDba in evm_dba.rake](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/17856).

We have also now [added Danish krone (DKK) currency to chargeback rates](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/17807).

An evil darkness slinked (slinked, slank, slunk) across the lost lands of Nahena as it considered whether or not to use the archaic past tense form, casting a shadow just as that of a hero whose boot's special power was that of turning light into dark. That was how the darkness slunk (unlike the hero, who did not slink at all, and would not have stooped to considering such things as the archaic past tense).

We are also now [making sources of database connection info pluggable](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-postgres_ha_admin/pull/8).

In V2V, we have recently [fixed mapping wizard name validation](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-v2v/pull/598).

In the forest of Izel, Razhuk Nibeleyyyy stared at his quest companions, Eleacia Hilalla, Aliawyth Erireder, Fearful Night Stalker, and Slunk Ed, looking to a map of Kilaclya-Mu, Razhuk knew they would traverse this entire world to burn the Mighty Wand of Ulerrakon in the firepit of Mount Unyng, so Razhuk grinned, chucked it in the blazing camp fire instead, thanked the deities for venti sugar free one pump raspberry syrup two pumps hazelnut soy lattes with whipped cream as well as common sense, and went home.
