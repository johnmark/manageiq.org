[Earlier this week](http://manageiq.org/blog/2014/11/ruby-2-update), we mentioned moving to ruby 2 on our github repository and in travis-ci for testing.  Ruby 2 nightly build appliances based on sprint 15 are [available here](http://manageiq.org/download/devel/).

In addition to the fixes and features added in [sprint 15](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/issues?q=milestone%3A%22Sprint+15+Ending+Nov+10%2C+2014%22) ([watch demo video](http://youtu.be/DnfCCHCflZ4), ruby 2.0 adds significant performance improvements, new features, and is actively maintained.  I highlighted many of the ruby 2.0 changes in my [design summit presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/ManageIQ/design-summit-migrating-to-ruby-2).

We are excited to continue to upgrade our ruby and rails stack and would like any feedback you have regarding these new appliances.

Thanks!
