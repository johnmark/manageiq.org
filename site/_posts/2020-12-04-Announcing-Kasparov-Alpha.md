The first alpha release of ManageIQ Kasparov is here!  It has a bunch of interesting new stuff that you can see in the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/ManageIQ/projects/13#column-8431168). Here are the major highlights for this new release:

* [Providers] 5 new provider plugins
  * IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud
  * IBM Cloud Power Virtual Servers
  * IBM Terraform
  * IBM AutoSDE
  * VMware NSX-T
