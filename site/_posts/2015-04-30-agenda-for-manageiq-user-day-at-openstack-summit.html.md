As I mentioned in a [previous blog post](/blog/2015/04/manageiq-at-openstack-summit/), we are having a [day to ourselves](http://miq-oss-cday.eventbrite.com/) on Wednesday, May 20 at the upcoming [OpenStack Summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit/vancouver-2015/) in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia. 

We've been prepping and now have an agenda:

- 1:50 - 2:30 pm - Managing OpenStack Infrastructure with ManageIQ, John Hardy, Red Hat
  - Learn how adding hybrid cloud management capabilities brings enterprise readiness to OpenStack, by the product manager who makes it go for customers
- 2:40 - 4:10 pm - ManageIQ Lab #1
  - This is an opportunity to get your hands dirty and work with a live ManageIQ deployment. Learn what makes it the leading open source hybrid cloud management platform. 
- 4:30 - 5:10 pm - ManageIQ Lab #2
  - Same as above, now fueled by an afternoon snack break
- 5:10 - 6pm - Botvinnik Release Party
  - ManageIQ Botvinnik is into its 2nd release candidate, with a third around the corner. Celebrate Botvinnik's imminent birth with some food and beverage on us.
