The votes are in, and ["Botvinnik" is the winner](http://talk.manageiq.org/t/planning-the-b-release/115)! In planning for [Botvinnik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Botvinnik) (which we'll sometimes shorten to "bot") we're now [accepting blueprints](http://talk.manageiq.org/t/about-the-blueprints-category/122) for proposed features. Just submit your blueprint and make sure to [categorize it properly](http://talk.manageiq.org/category/developers/blueprints). Next, you'll need to [propose an abstract](http://talk.manageiq.org/t/about-the-abstracts-category/129) for the [ManageIQ Design Summit](http://miqdevsummit14.eventbrite.com/). Make sure to put your proposal in the [Abstracts category](http://talk.manageiq.org/category/abstracts).

If your blueprints or talks are accepted, you'll get a free pass to the design summit, as will anyone who has contributed code, documentation or end user support to the community. This is a great opportunity to get involved and influence the direction of the ManageIQ community.

Submit your blueprints by September 15. Abstracts will be selected on a rolling basis until the agenda is full, so the earlier the better!
