On behalf of the ManageIQ team, we're pleased to announce the Release Cadidate of ManageIQ Euwe!

Euwe is the next milestone release for ManageIQ cloud and virtualization management platform. With each release, ManageIQ gets more robust and feature complete across providers. In this release, we concentrated on stablization fixes prior to the upcoming GA release. There are also updates to Providers as well as continuing performance improvements.

* **Schedule Automate tasks** through the user interface in the same way that you schedule SmartState Analyses.
* **Notification Methods** have been added to Automate allow users to create custom notifications.
* **Chargeback Calculations** have been reworked based on interval duration instead of being based on the count of metrics.
* **Topology views** have been added to both OpenStack Cloud and OpenStack Infrastructure providers.
