Vote for the H-Release!!! Here is the [Poll](http://talk.manageiq.org/t/voting-on-name-of-h-release/2865) on talk.manageiq.org

While we close in on the Gaprindashvili release, it’s time to think about what we'll name the H-Release.  In keeping with our nomenclature of using chess grandmasters and world champions as release names, here are the proposed names for the H-Release, as well some interesting background data:

- [Hammer, Jon Ludvig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Ludvig_Hammer) (June 02,1990 – ) Peak rating 2705 (February 2016)
Hammer was Norwegian Chess Champion in 2013 and 2017. He was the main second for Magnus Carlsen in the World Chess Championship 2013. Hammer has been described as taking chess very seriously, playing very often online, in tournaments, or practicing. In 2009, Hammer announced he would not pursue a professional chess career and would study economics. In 2012, he switched to journalism, writing for Science Nordic as part of his degree studies.

Hort defected to the West after the 1985 Tunis Interzonal, moving to West Germany and winning the national championship of his new homeland in 1987, 1989, and 1991.
- [Hou, Yifan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hou_Yifan) (February 27, 1994 – ) Peak rating 2686 (March 2015)
