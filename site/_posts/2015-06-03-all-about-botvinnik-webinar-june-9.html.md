[RSVP for the Botvinnik webinar!](https://manageiq-release.eventbrite.com/)

We're quickly coming up on the official release of ManageIQ Botvinnik. If you're curious about what are the most important additions to ManageIQ and how to use them, come to our online meetup next week where we'll walk through the major changes and run through some demos to show them in action.

[RSVP at our EventBrite page](https://manageiq-release.eventbrite.com/). After you RSVP, we'll send you a link for viewing the event.

This is a great way to get familiar with all the great things we've added over the last 7 - 8 months.
