Here's a great [introduction written by Bryan Che](http://tentenet.net/2014/06/19/the-third-tenet-of-open-source-open-source-requires-commitment-welcome-manageiq/), a Red Hat cloud strategy guy, on why we released ManageIQ as an open source project, as well as a look at the cloud management landscape. Cloud management is currently a nice car with four flat tires, and all four of them with different sizes, colors, and recommended pressure.

From the blog post:

> This marks a major milestone not just for Red Hat but also
> for open source in general.  ManageIQ is a significant and
> unique open source project for several reasons:
>
>*   ManageIQ is the first major open source project for a management platform
>*   ManageIQ came from an existing codebase, not as net new development
>*  ManageIQ targets a new kind of community

That last bit is pretty important. Most communities identify their audience as "developers" and "users". With ManageIQ, there's a slight difference:

>ManageIQ includes a policy and orchestration engine for integrating into and automating a wide variety of platforms. We are excited to see what administrators and operators might contribute in the form of workflows and integration points to the ManageIQ community.
