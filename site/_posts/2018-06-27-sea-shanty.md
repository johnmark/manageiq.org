Here are the full lyrics: 

Oh, we'd be alright if we could [suspend providers](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/17500)   
We'd be alright if we could suspend providers    
We'd be alright if we could suspend providers    
And we'll all hang on behind...   
 
And we'll ro-o-oll the old chariot along!   
We'll ro-o-oll the old chariot along!      
We'll ro-o-oll the old chariot along!      
And we'll all hang on behind!     
 
Oh, we'd be alright if we [used pluck on metric rollups](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/17560)    
We'd be alright if we used pluck on metric rollups    
We'd be alright if we used pluck on metric rollups    
And we'll all hang on behind...    
 
And we'll ro-o-oll the old chariot along!    
We'll ro-o-oll the old chariot along!    
We'll ro-o-oll the old chariot along!    
And we'll all hang on behind!    
 
Well [ancestry patch fixes](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/17511) wouldn't do us any harm    
Yeah, ancestry patch fixes wouldn't do us any harm    
Oh, ancestry patch fixes wouldn't do us any harm    
And we'll all hang on behind...    
 
And we'll ro-o-oll the old chariot along!    
We'll ro-o-oll the old chariot along!    
We'll ro-o-oll the old chariot along!    
And we'll all hang on behind!    
 
[Enabling AWS events](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-documentation/pull/867) wouldn't do us any harm    
Oh, enabling AWS events wouldn't do us any harm    
Woah, enabling AWS events wouldn't do us any harm    
And we'll all hang on behind...    
 
And we'll ro-o-oll the old chariot along!    
We'll ro-o-oll the old chariot along!    
We'll ro-o-oll the old chariot along!    
And we'll all hang on behind!    

Oh, we'd be alright if we [lost translation-breaking whitespace](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-ui-service/pull/1439)    
We'd be alright if we lost translation-breaking whitespace    
We'd be alright if we lost translation-breaking whitespace    
And we'll all hang on behind...    
 
And we'll ro-o-oll the old chariot along!    
We'll ro-o-oll the old chariot along!    
We'll ro-o-oll the old chariot along!    
And we'll all hang on behind...    

Oh, we'd be alright if we [fixed catalog item forms](https://github.com/ManageIQ/integration_tests/pull/7361)    
We'd be alright if we fixed catalog item forms    
We'd be alright if we fixed catalog item forms    
And we'll all hang on behind...    
 
And we'll ro-o-oll the old chariot along!    
We'll ro-o-oll the old chariot along!    
We'll ro-o-oll the old chariot along!    
And we'll all hang on behind...
