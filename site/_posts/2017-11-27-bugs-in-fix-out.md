Hello there! This week's LWIMIQ is contributed by [Harpreet](https://github.com/h-kataria)
Hope everyone in the US had a wonderful time enjoying Thanksgiving feast with family and friends, and of course shopping Black Friday deals. With Christmas and New Year right around the corner everyone must be in holiday mode, while our team at ManageIQ is working hard to get Gaprindashvili as stable as possible. Since we are in a bug fixing phase not much to report features/enhancement wise from my side.

## Improved

This week's improvements were made by fixing bugs and making Gaprindashvili more stable.

## Fixed

There were lots issues fixed around our list view screens in UI, relationships links were fixed on some screens, more details of the bug can be seen here [GTL fixes](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-ui-classic/pull/2804). There were fixes made around new dialog editor and dialog runner with some missing /double form buttons.

## New

Nothing new added this week, since it is a bug fixing time, you should see mostly PRs labelled as Bug.
