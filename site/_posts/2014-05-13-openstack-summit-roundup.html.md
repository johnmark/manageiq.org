As I mentioned in the [previous blog post](/blog/2014/05/welcome-to-the-manageiq-community/),
it's a great day to be in the cloud. Yesterday marked our announcement
at the OpenStack Summit, and the reaction was pretty swift and positive.
There is pent-up demand for software that lets others take control of
their clouds and virtualization environments.

### The Founding Community Members

We recognize that the success of ManageIQ depends on collaboration with
a variety of actors, and that certainly includes the founding community
members. We know we can't be successful if it's just one entity behind
ManageIQ, so we are very proud of being able to launch with an array of
such talented and capable partners. Here, in their words, is their take
on ManageIQ:

[CiRBA Press Release](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/cirba-joins-red-hat-in-open-cloud-management-community-2014-05-12)
 - CiRBA does capacity management and
automation, which figures heavily into ManageIQ's development.

[Chef Blog Post](http://www.getchef.com/blog/2014/05/12/chef-joins-red-hats-manageiq-community/)
 - Chef is an open source platform for IT automation and
configuration management. They are looking to build hooks to make Chef
the top configuration management provider in the ManageIQ community.

There will be updates all week from our partners - look for those on
the ManageIQ blog.

### Your Gateway to the Open Cloud

In all, yesterday was a blur. There was much excitement about the
announcement, and there's a lot more excitement on tap. We still have
code reviews to finish and other loose ends to tie up, but we're
looking forward to enabling cloud and virtualization admins to have
ultimate control over their environments. This allows them to be more
agile and gives them ultimate choice, making decisions based on their
needs, not their cloud providers' demands.
