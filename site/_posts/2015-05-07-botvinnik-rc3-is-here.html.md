The next Botvinnik release candidate, RC3, is now ready for [download](/download/devel/). Either use the site's [download workflow](/download/devel/) or pick what you want from the [list of available images](http://releases.manageiq.org/). Report issues in this thread and link to the [GitHub issue URL](https://github.com/manageiq/manageiq/issues).
