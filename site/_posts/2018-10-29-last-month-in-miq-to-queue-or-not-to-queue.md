[To queue, or not to queue](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/18041), that is the question:  
Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer  
The Slings and Arrows of [memcached in containers](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/18051),  
Or to take Arms against a Sea of [zone spec failures](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/18118),  
And by opposing end [them](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/18095): to die, to sleep  
No more; and by a sleep, to say we end  
The [Heart-ache](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/18114), and [the thousand Natural shocks](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/18092)  
That Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation  
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,  
To sleep, [perchance to Dream](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/18131); Aye, there's the rub.
