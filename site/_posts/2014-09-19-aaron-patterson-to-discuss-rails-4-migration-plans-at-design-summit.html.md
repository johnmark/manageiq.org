If you're headed to the [ManageIQ Design Summit on October 7 & 8](http://miqdevsummit14.eventbrite.com/), you're in for a treat. Aaron Patterson ([@tenderlove](http://twitter.com/tenderlove)) will be leading a session in the design track on the topic of migrating ManageIQ to Ruby on Rails 4.

One of the things Aaron will valiantly tackle, in addition to Rails 4 migration and his general all-around awesomeness, is ensuring that ManageIQ stays in sync with upstream gems. At the [design summit](http://miqdevsummit14.eventbrite.com/) you'll have a chance to hear him talk about these and other topics - essential knowledge for developers.
