We can now take the covers off of the ManageIQ [Community Depot](/depot) and show it to you live. Just understand it's in beta and may (will) have some bugs. The Depot is where you can share, download and collaborate on extensions and other software built for ManageIQ.

If you want to contribute your code to the Depot, just [follow the steps in the README.md](https://github.com/manageiq/manageiq_depot). If you find any issues with the site, please [report them on our GitHub tracker](https://github.com/manageiq/manageiq_depot/issues).

We will be adding a significant number of extensions and other software components that help to round out your ManageIQ deployments. Submit yours today - or collaborate on an existing project.
