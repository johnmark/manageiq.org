There is a ManageIQ Sprint review every 3 weeks, and everyone in the community is welcome to participate. To join our Sprint review meeting, please use this [Bluejeans link](https://bluejeans.com/946365937/).

For Sprint 43, we merged 329 pull requests, making this a regular sprint averaging 100 PRs per week. There is a good distribution between new features, bug fixes, and code refactoring. We have plenty of enhancements on the Providers side, including Amazon, Networking, and Hawkular.  Work has started on a Service Broker, which is a new piece for ManageIQ to allow VM selection based on criteria you provide.  

SmartState has been extended with a generalized disk LRU caching module, which will be employed to address Azure performance and throttling issues. PostgreSQL has been upgraded to 9.5. There are also many User Interface updates, explained in detail in the [following video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnD1lvzsjB0) of the meeting, including a couple of demos in the Providers area (Recheck Authentication and Credentials Validation).

On June 30, we released [Darga 2](http://manageiq.org/blog/2016/06/darga-2-announcementt/) containing mainly bug fixes and stabilization. With already over 200 PRs backported, we'll continute to stabilize Darga 3 aimed for an end-August release.

In case you missed it, we also started a new blog series, "Last week in ManageIQ", where select pull requests from the codebase are featured weekly. As it's impractical to go through all the 300+ contributions during Sprint reviews, this is a great way to check out some highlights each week. The [first post](http://manageiq.org/blog/2016/07/last-week-in-manageiq-faster-reports-cloud-networks-and-more/) was published this Tuesday. We hope you'll find it interesting and useful!

Sprint 44 review will be on August 3, 2016 @ [7:30am PDT/10:30am EDT/14:30 GMT](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=ManageIQ+Sprint+44+review&iso=20160803T1430). You can import the [ManageIQ community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=contact%40manageiq.org) to be notified about this and future Sprint reviews.
