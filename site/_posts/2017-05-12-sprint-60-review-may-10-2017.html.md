Sprint 60 is mostly focused on the stabilization of upcoming Fine release, with close to half of the total 570 pull requests (a new high) going towards bug fixes. This sprint marks the first time that the [Classic UI repo](https://github.com/manageiq/manageiq-ui-classic) has outpaced the [core ManageIQ repo](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq) in PRs, 158 to 148. From Sprint 52 to 60, the number of ManageIQ repositories went from 103 to 114 (11 new repos over 8 sprints), and more are being planned. We have a new "Repository Health Report" which includes number of files, [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/) GPA scores and issues, as well as test coverages across different repos.

A major refactoring effort in the Classic UI replaced all the GTL (Grid/Tile/List) Views to be managed by Angular, even nested ones. This brings us one step closer to changing all the views to use the REST API behind Angular support. It also results in improvements to the UI, such as the new pagination not requiring refresh of the whole screen.

Service UI adds a new feature to handle batch notifications better. Previously, if there are multiple notifications coming in, the end-user will be spammed by them. With the change, it will now show a maximum of 6 notices, after which you'll get a message to check the notification drawer. Upon expanding the drawer you'll see all the notifications organized by categories. This uses the PatternFly notification drawer component to align closer with Classic UI.

The Amazon provider made several enhancements for this sprint: CloudWatch Events are now visible in VM Timelines, deletion of S3 folders is supported, plus the refreshing of floating IP and port for a load balancer. Remaining work includes the refactoring and cleanup of the refresh parser.

For more highlights from Sprint 60, we have the addition of quota checking for VM Reconfigure; Escalate privilege option to Catalog Item configuration in Ansible Integration; removal of the default certificate from appliance so that a unique one is auto-generated on first launch of the appliance; introduction of Custom Actions for VMs; and plenty of enhancements in documentation such as configuring ManageIQ to work with load balancers, and a procedure outlining how to refresh Ansible repositories.

All these and more in the [Sprint 60 highlight reel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tpCu-bdq-U), with section markings as follows.
