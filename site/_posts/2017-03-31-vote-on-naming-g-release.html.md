Vote for the G-Release!!! Here is the [Poll](http://talk.manageiq.org/t/voting-on-name-of-g-release/2225) on talk.manageiq.org

While we close in on the Fine release, it’s time to think about how we will name the G-Release.  In keeping with our nomenclature of using chess grandmasters and world champions as release names, here are the proposed names for the G-Release, as well some interesting background data:

- [Ganguly, Surya Shekhar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya_Shekhar_Ganguly) (February 24, 1983 – ) Peak rating 2676 (July 2016)
Ganguly became an International Master at 16 and a Grandmaster at 19. Ganguly's grandfather, the late Anil Basumallick, taught him chess at the age of 5. While Ganguly is a fine positional player, he also relishes complicated positions.
- [Gaprindashvili, Nona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nona_Gaprindashvili) (May 03, 1941 – ) Peak rating 2495 (July 1987)
Gaprindashvili is the sixth women's world chess champion (1962–1978), and in 1978 became the first female Grandmaster. She also went on to defend her title successfully four times.
- [Gashimov, Vugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vugar_Gashimov) (July 24, 1986 – January 11, 2014) Peak Rating 2761 (January 2012)
Gashimov was an Azerbaijani chess grandmaster. He was a noted player of blitz chess. At his peak ranking he was No. 6 in the world, achieved in November 2009. At the peak of his playing career, he revived the fortunes of the Modern Benoni, an opening that had become unpopular at the top level of chess.
- [Gelfand, Boris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Gelfand) (June 24, 1968 – ) Peak rating 2777 (November 2013)
Gelfand’s parents, Abram and Nella, were engineers. His father bought him a book about chess, Journey to the Chess Kingdom, by Averbakh and Beilin, when he was five years old. Gelfand has competed in eleven Chess Olympiads and has held a place within the top 30 players ranked by FIDE rating since January 1990. He is also a six-time World-Championship Candidate, playing in the 2012 World Championship vs Anand and losing on tiebreaks.
- [Geller, Efim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efim_Geller) (March 08, 1925 – November 17, 1998) Peak rating 2630 (January 1971)
Geller was coach to World Champions Boris Spassky and Anatoly Karpov, as well as an author. He was known as a fine basketball player, and earned his doctorate in physical education before specializing in chess. Geller is reckoned to have been among the best ten players in the world for around twenty years. He is also one of the few people in the world with a positive score against Bobby Fischer as well as a combined positive score against 6 World Champions.
- [Grünfeld, Ernst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Gr%C3%BCnfeld) (November 21, 1893 – April 03, 1962)
Grünfeld had lost a leg in his early childhood, and his family was also beset by poverty. However, he discovered chess, studied intensely, and quickly earned a reputation as a skilled player. His style of avoiding complex variations together with an essentially drawish nature was simply not good enough to trouble the world's best. Grunfeld was also the inventor of the eponymous Grünfeld Defense which is extremely popular in high-level tournament play.
