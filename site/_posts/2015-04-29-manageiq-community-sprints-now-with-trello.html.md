If you've been participating in our [sprint reports](/blog/2015/03/sprint-21-report-march-31-2015/), you've no doubt found them to be an excellent way to stay apprised of feature progress in ManageIQ. I'm happy to announce that our community activities are now part of the 3-week sprints and included in the sprint reports.

You can also stay up to date with all [community activities on our Trello board](https://trello.com/b/sogANZVl/manageiq-org-community), or just stay tuned for the next sprint report.
