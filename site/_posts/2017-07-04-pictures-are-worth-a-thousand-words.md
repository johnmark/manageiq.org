Hi All, [syncrou](https://github.com/syncrou) here to welcome you to another round of Last Week in ManageIQ.
Since we're in the throws of summer, I am the last *weekly* writer of Last Week in ManageIQ until the fall.

Over the next few months we will be writing *bi-weekly* entries to keep you in the loop regarding all the happenings
over here in ManageIQ land.

## Featured

If you haven't been reading the last number of blog entries over this past year, you probably wouldn't
know the single major theme we've been covering.  If you have, then the next sentence will not be a surprise.

We've been breaking out the main ManageIQ app into smaller pieces to make the code base ( and of course testing it )
easier to manage.

For those looking for a phrase:  Extracting Singular Entities into Separate Repositories.

All that being said, it's very difficult to write a single blog post about all the stuff we're working on
while giving credit where credit is due.

This week, I'm simply going to give credit in images.

After all, like they say: A picture is worth a thousand words.
