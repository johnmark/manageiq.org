I'm happy to report that we will be having a [birds-of-a-feather meetup](https://miq-rhsummit2015.eventbrite.com) (aka "BoF") at [Red Hat Summit](http://www.redhat.com/summit/) on Thursday, June 25 at 4pm EDT. A BoF is an informal gathering of people who come together to discuss a particular topic, in this case ManageIQ. We would like to use this opportunity to share some of the community highlights from the previous year, as well as discuss the upcoming roadmap and Capablanca release cycle.

It will be in the Sheraton Boston, and you don't need to have a Red Hat Summit pass to attend, although we certainly hope you'll be at the summit anyway. 

[RSVP now!](https://miq-rhsummit2015.eventbrite.com/)
