Vote for the F-Release!!! Here is the [Poll](http://talk.manageiq.org/t/voting-on-name-of-f-release/1881) on talk.manageiq.org

We are closing in on the final Euwe release.  So, it’s time to think about how we will name the F-Release.  In keeping with our nomenclature of using chess grandmasters and world champions as release names, here are the proposed names for the F-Release, as well some interesting background data:

- [Fine, Reuben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuben_Fine) (October 11, 1914 – March 26, 1993)
During World War II, Fine worked for the U.S. Navy, analyzing the probability of German U-boats surfacing at certain points in the Atlantic Ocean. Fine also worked as a translator. Fine has played ManageIQ's previously named releases; Botvinnik, Capablanca, and Euwe.
- [Finegold, Ben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Finegold) (September 6, 1969 – )
Finegold was born into a chess family and became a USCF Master at the age of 14 and International Master at 20. He is a live commentator at US Chess Championship, US Junior Chess Championship and Sinquefield Cup; and teaches weekly lectures at the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of Saint Louis. Finegold's lectures are available on YouTube.
- [Fischer, Robert James "Bobby"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer) (March 9, 1943 – January 17, 2008)
Many consider Fischer to be the greatest chess player of all time. In 1972, he captured the World Chess Championship from Boris Spassky of the USSR in a match held in Reykjavík, Iceland. The match was publicized as a Cold War confrontation, which attracted more worldwide interest than any chess championship before or since. It was reported that Fischer's last words before his death were, "Nothing is as healing as the human touch."
- [Flohr, Salomon Mikhailovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salo_Flohr) (November 21, 1908 – July 18, 1983)
Flohr became a national hero in Czechoslovakia during the 1930s. His name was used to sell many of the luxury products of the time, including Salo Flohr cigarettes, slippers and eau-de-cologne. The German invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938 had left Flohr, as a Polish-Ukrainian Jew, in grave personal danger. Flohr and his family eventually fled to Moscow with the help of his friend Botvinnik.
- [Fressinet, Laurent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent_Fressinet) (November 30, 1981 – )
Fressinet won the French Chess Championship in 2010 and 2014. In October 2015 at the 2nd PokerStars Isle of Man International Chess Tournament, Fressinet won the 4th Anatoly Karpov Trophy rapid tournament in Cap d'Agde by defeating Karpov himself in the final 3-1. He is married to International Master Almira Skripchenko.
- [Furman, Semyon Abramovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semyon_Furman) (December 1, 1920 – March 17, 1978)
Furman was a Soviet chess International Grandmaster and trainer. He is best known for developing Anatoly Karpov into a World Chess Champion, but was a formidable player himself, as well as a successful coach for several other world-class players. Interestingly, Furman did not become a Grandmaster until 1966, at age 46.
