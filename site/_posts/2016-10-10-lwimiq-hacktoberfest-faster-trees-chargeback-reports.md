Hello again! [Tim](https://twitter.com/imtayadeway) here with a
wrap-up of all the ManageIQ activity from last week.

## Featured

[contributors board][Contributors] why not check out one of our

you tackle some issues labeled `hacktoberfest` during the month of
October. Head over to the [official website][Hacktoberfest] for more
details! üçª

## Improved

### [Improve Retrieval of VMware Host Storage Devices](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/11629)

Host storage devices are retrieved one at a time to limit the chance
of a timeout resulting from too much data going over the
line. However, that is no longer a concern and requests can be
packaged into one API call thanks to this PR.

### [Move most of TreeNodeBuilder#build to hash lookup](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/11604)

By moving to a constant time hash lookup for calls made to nodes in
trees, [Nick LaMuro](https://github.com/NickLaMuro) was able to
squeeze some extra performance out of some large trees. üå≤

### [Remove to_a at core of Automate](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/11703)

By removing the call of `to_a`, these Active Record relations can
continue without loading every single row into memory until
needed. Especially handy if you were just going to throw most of them
away anyway!

## Fixed

### [Show shared networks in the OpenStack provisioning dialog](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/11653)

Shared networks in the OpenStack provisioning dialog were lost during
a prior refactoring. This PR ensures they are back in their rightful place. üêõ

## New

### [Add chargeback report for Services](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/11570)

This PR adds a monthly chargeback report for Services. üìä

### [Add UI to create/update/delete OpenStack cloud tenants](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/11259)

As of this PR, a user is now able to do full CRUD on OpenStack cloud
tenants. üéâ

## Deleted

### Some old comments get the heave-ho

Last week [Joe Rafaniello](https://github.com/jrafanie) found some
[truly](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/11727)
[vintage](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/11725) comments
going back before 2011. They are gone now thanks to these PRs, but
their intentions will always be around in our hearts (and in the
commit history). üî•

### [Remove unused toolbar buttons from toolbar builder](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/11688)

Apparently these toolbar buttons were no longer needed, meaning that
32 lines of code could be straight-up deleted! ‚úÇÔ∏è

### [Remove leftover rubyrep password checking code](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/11668)

When rubyrep was removed back in
[#9696](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/9696) this code was
left behind, resulting in a bug in the UI. On the bright side, this PR
lets us say goodbye to rubyrep one more time! üëã
