Last Month in MIQ is a column about code and code things: everything code, except actual code.

We're [working](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/18476) on [our ruby update](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/18392), which is super-cool.

It's time to speak about unspeakable :ghost: atrocities from the fifth edition. Or February. Or both February and edition five. 

We [got rid of vmdb_database attributes from VmdbDatabaseConnection](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/18442).

You all get points for not a one of you noticing that there was no post last month, nor the month before that. Very observant crowd. 

[Floating IPs are now available for reporting](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/18422).

So next time you catch yourself wondering what questions they will ask you as they snicker about how horrible this all is, remind yourself that you are a chump. A mighty, convicted chump, with fruit snacks, and a better and perhaps only slightly sophomoric understanding of the unspeakable atrocities from the fifth edition.
