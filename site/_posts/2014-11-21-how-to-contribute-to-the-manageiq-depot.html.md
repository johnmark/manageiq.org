The ManageIQ Depot will be where community members can collaborate, share and download extensions and other software developed for the ManageIQ hybrid cloud management platform. I made a quick video showing how to grab the latest [depot code from GitHub](http://github.com/manageiq/manageiq_depot), add your extension, and then test it locally before issuing a pull request to add it to the git repository.
