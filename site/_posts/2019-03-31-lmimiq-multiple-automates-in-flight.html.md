`1.` We no longer [start another refresh worker while another is stopping](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/18583). If you are still reading this, please continue to 2. 

`2.` We [dropped the MiqEnterprise#is_enterprise? method](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/18572). Go to 3.

`3.` If [you remove references to MiqPassword](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/18567), go to 4. If you instead [add Volume Resizing capability to SupportsFeatureMixin](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/18560), go to 4. 

`4.` Go to [5](). Yes. You're right. There is no [5](). This is a world in which there is no [5](). If you manage to battle your existential crisis brought on by the lack of [5](), continue to 6. If you don't, please go to 10. 

`6.` Go to 7. Or go back to 1. Either way you will end up at 7.

`7.` Please go to 6. Unless you'd like to [look at the new Rbac virtual attributes change](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/18543) and also go to 6. It doesn't make much difference. 

`11.` You lost. I'm not sure how you ended up here. Clearly you're unable to follow directions. Please re-evaluate your life choices and next time follow the instructions better. Go to [5](), but not before seeing that we're now [adding report interval date and report generation to Chargeback reports](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/18569).

`8.` Please go to 9 and see that we've [refactored the MiqTask#generic_action_with_callback method](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/18578). 

`9.` Do not pass go. Do not collect two hundred dollars. Look at [the new region checking for all user schedules](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/18512). But do please feel free to continue onto 10. 

`10.` Please go back to 4.
