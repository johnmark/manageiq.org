## Building A Blog Post

I think you all by now know what a blog is. Though with each one I write, folk seem to be less sure. 

(We can talk bout more than one thing by adding an "s" to the end of a noun.)

I have of late heard talk as to the fact that my words are too long, so I thought we could use a new mode.

(We can talk bout past things by adding an "ed" to the end of verbs.)

It is not new at all, to be clear, there is not a thing new here, I have yanked this straight from Guy Steele. Luck is with me in that his name is short. 

(We can talk bout not past and not now things with an "ing" put on the end of verbs.)

I am not at all sure you know why we blog, though. You see it is rare that the stuff we talk is what the talk is dealing with. We want to be seen by people. 

It's why we text. It's why we call. It's why we blog.  

It may seem odd, but, you see, for this post, I wanted to show you what it is like to use words that are much too small. You have now had a taste of it.

I bet a few of you at least have seen [the talk from which this is from](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/steele.pdf).

(We can talk about one thing, or more than one, and seven is a word, of a few such words, that we can use to talk about more than one.)


Seven not true things we cleansed our code of this week: 

[UI appliances without the reporting role can create queue messages that never get processed.](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/18041)

[Encrypted values must be encrypted twice.](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/18031)

[AR models do not need to be backed by a canonical table.](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/18003)

[It is possible to queue things for a zone that doesn't exist in the region in question.](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/17987)

All misspellings are actually Britishisms in disguise. 

[CPU, CPU cores, and Memory metering allocation need not appear on metering reports.](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/17938)

[React forms documentation is nonexistent.](https://github.com/ManageIQ/guides/pull/328)
