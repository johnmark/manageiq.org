I am excited to share this piece of news with the community: the second ManageIQ Design Summit will take place this summer, on June 6 & 7 (Mon-Tue), at the Sheraton Mahwah Hotel in Mahwah, New Jersey.

The ManageIQ Design Summit is for everyone in the ManageIQ community and anyone interested in this open-source cloud management platform. Whether you're a user wishing to learn more about leveraging the powers of ManageIQ, a contributing partner/developer wanting to discuss the future directions and roadmap of this project, or a community member with the desire to contribute to this great community, we have something for you!

The summit presents an excellent opportunity to engage with your fellow community members. Perhaps on how adopting ManageIQ has streamlined your projectâ€™s workflow, the different integration efforts and use-cases, proposing new feature implementations, or maybe even some challenges faced and lessons-learned. We will be opening a Call for Presentations soon, so watch this space.

We are working with Sheraton Mahwah to provide a conducive event venue, and a place for you to have a good night's rest during the summit. To book your accommodation at the special rate of 139 USD per night, you can:

1. call 1-888-627-8146 and ask for the Red Hat / Manage IQ room block
2. make the reservation with [this link](https://www.starwoodmeeting.com/Book/RedHatManageIQ2016)

Please register for the ManageIQ Design Summit on the [Eventbrite page](http://miqsummit2016.eventbrite.com/). We will follow up shortly with more information and logistics about the event. In the meantime, if you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask in the comments.

We look forward to seeing you in June!
