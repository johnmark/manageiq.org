Happy New Year! We're starting off 2017 with a notable change in the ManageIQ process. In an effort to become more agile, and allow more flexibility in planning and scheduling, we will be switching from 3-week Sprints to 2-week Sprints.

We had the Sprint 51 review meeting yesterday (Jan 4) as planned, and from now on the meetings will occur fortnightly. The next 3 sprint reviews are as follows:

- [Sprint 52: January 18, 2017 @ 7:30 PST/10:30 EST/15:30 GMT](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=ManageIQ+Sprint+52+review&iso=20170118T1530)
- [Sprint 53: February 1, 2017 @ 7:30 PST/10:30 EST/15:30 GMT](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=ManageIQ+Sprint+53+review&iso=20170201T1530)
- [Sprint 54: February 15, 2017 @ 7:30 PST/10:30 EST/15:30 GMT](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=ManageIQ+Sprint+54+review&iso=20170215T1530)

As always, you can participate in the ManageIQ Sprint review via [Bluejeans](https://bluejeans.com/5927041376/), and import the [ManageIQ community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=contact%40manageiq.org), which has been updated with the abovementioned change. If you missed the meetings, you can find a recap in the [Sprint review blog posts](/blog/tags/sprints/).

See you at Sprint 52 in 2 weeks!
