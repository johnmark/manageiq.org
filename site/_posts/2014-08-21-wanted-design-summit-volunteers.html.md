If you'd like to volunteer to put together the upcoming [ManageIQ Design Summit](http://miqdevsummit14.eventbrite.com/), let it be known in the [comments section of this blog post](/blog/2014/08/wanted-design-summit-volunteers/#comments). We will start having weekly meetings for the purpose of putting together the agenda, and we need volunteers to review abstracts and potential speakers.
