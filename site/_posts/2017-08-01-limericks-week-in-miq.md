##### read me   
This post in form is quite new  
Again we’ve code changes to view  
If you would like to listen  
There’s a video submission  
This post courtesy of you know who.  

To my accomplice offer much gratitude  
The video’s a great interlude  
To give credit where due,  
Thank [Allen B W](https://github.com/AllenBW),  
Whose assistance was greatly valued.   

New code changes are easily viewed  
Two week’s worth is some amplitude  
Peruse them all [here](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Amerged%20base%3Amaster%20merged%3A%222017-07-17%20..%202017-07-30%22%20sort%3Acreated-desc%20 )  
We’ve been busy, it’s clear  
With plentiful changes accrued.  

The dialog editor’s long overlooked  
But with [pretty changes](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-ui-classic/pull/1398), we’re all really hooked.  
See drag and drop,  
The Ops UI pop,  
Related bug fixes are booked.  

Large removals are always well-greeted  
Non-shared Ansible tests were deleted  
If you’d like to admire,  
[This one](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/15594) will inspire  
Cassette cuts to soon be completed.  

Validation of provider credentials  
Includes raw_connect in its essentials  
The move to the queue  
Needs decrypt to go through  
[The specifics](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-providers-vmware/pull/69) have lots of potentials.    

Default value selection was broken  
In the service UI, it was spoken  
A coder from Houston  
Had fixes induced in  
A PR that is [hereby bespoken](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-ui-service/pull/849).  

Some catalogue BZs have been closed  
Doc notes have been newly composed  
Azure items are easy  
And Amazon breezy  
The details have [here](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-documentation/pull/441) been exposed.  

Logo rendering has now been adjusted  
As spacing had been somewhat busted  
Docker whale resized,  
The layout revised  
[Mobile styling](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq.org/pull/571) no longer combusted.  

Our integration test repo’s abuzz  
Includes Widgetastic now [it does](https://github.com/ManageIQ/integration_tests/pull/5006)  
Some python’s included  
Enhancements subtruded  
Less web-widget abstracted twas.  

[Provider generators](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-providers-openshift/pull/38) can be synced  
From the core repo to which they’re linked  
Shared specs are looked for,  
Refactors we adore  
We’re just thrilled when updates are succinct.  

Generic Objects page has been refreshed  
Feature names are hence newly addressed  
Fresh sections galore  
Old views are done for   
You’ll find show_list is now [at its best](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/15611)!  

A coder who is from Hong Kong  
Insisted credentials belong  
Azure Classic renewed  
So as not to exclude  
With Resource Manager [it’ll throng](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/15626).   

Metric collection has been quite updated  
From [sources that are not related](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-providers-kubernetes/pull/62)  
Not Hawkular-centered  
More places we’ve ventured  
Single vendors you’ll find are outdated.  

Seeding timeouts are being repaired  
WAN seeding no longer impaired  
If you wish, [take a gander](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/15595)  
It shall not meander  
Descriptive errors now are prepared.  

This amusement must come to an end  
Dear reader, [your help](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/issues) we commend  
If you’d like to submit  
Please add a commit  
Until then, the next post we attend.
