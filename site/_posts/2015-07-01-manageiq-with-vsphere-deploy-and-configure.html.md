Found a really great [blog post](http://www.jasongaudreau.com/2015/06/manageiq-with-vsphere-deploy-and.html), all about deploying ManageIQ within a VSphere environment written by [Jason Gaudreau](http://www.jasongaudreau.com/p/about.html):

> ManageIQ was made open source last summer; since it is a free download, I decided to try it out in my lab environment. I have it managing my vSphere lab infrastructure and my Amazon EC2 account.

It's a [really nice post](http://www.jasongaudreau.com/2015/06/manageiq-with-vsphere-deploy-and.html) that will help you get going managing VSphere as well as EC2.
