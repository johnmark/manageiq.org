I'm pleased to announce that the [ManageIQ](http://manageiq.org/) project will have a big showing at the upcoming [OpenStack Summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit/) in Vancouver, British Columbia. Here are the activities we have on tap:

- Monday, May 18: Birds of a feather - an hour-long extravaganza where we will talk about the latest and greatest in the ManageIQ community
- Wednesday, May 20: [ManageIQ Community Day](http://miq-oss-cday.eventbrite.com) - this will be a day-long workshop starting with introductory talks in the morning, a hands-on lab in the afternoon, and finishing up the day with a nice mixer
- Wednesday, May 20: Not to forget, [John Hardy](http://cloudformsnow.com/) will have a session in the summit on the subject of [OpenStack Infrastructure Management with ManageIQ](http://sched.co/2qh1)

[RSVP for the community day on our Eventbrite page](http://miq-oss-cday.eventbrite.com).
