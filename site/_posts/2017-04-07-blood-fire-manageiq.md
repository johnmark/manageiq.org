In the beginning there was nothing, which exploded. Same as this Last week in ManageIQ post.
My name is [Robin](https://github.com/panspagetka), from the [UI team](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-ui-classic/). If you are reading this, I hope you are very enthusiastic and have very poor English grammar skill.

I wanted to make an interview with the most famous person around here, George the Bunnygoat, but everything changed when fire nation attacked. I met his press secretary. He told me that George is currently unavailable, because he is counting sheep. I saw line of sheep, standing on road all the way to the horizon. I asked one sheep, what is going on here, but her answer wasn't useful. She said, and I quote, this: [“Hey Dude.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_MjCqQoLLA). And keep saying that again, again and again, like a sheep. Damn sheep!

## Story of Himdel
God of Javascript, Protector of Midgard, Angular’s Chosen One, Wielder of the Mighty Hammer of Refactoring, Destroyer of the Worlds, Harvester of Sorrow, The Funny Uncle (by his niece).

It was two minutes to midnight, Himdel decided. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. Ancient evil was sneaking around for years. Corrupting lands, poisoning minds, drowning kittens, obliterating nomadic tribes of engineers. Took his hammer, saddled horse, and rode. Seven days and seven nights he rode. Then he saw it. Formless, horrific shade, bigger than moon, spread across the lands. Himdel struck with hammer to the ground. Earth has shaken. Countless lightnings tore the sky apart. Shade collapsed.

“You think that this is the end? You think that you have won?  No! You can beat me. You may weaken me, but I will transform. You will never win! I will always prevail! In the end there will be only meee...“

Himdel looked at his horse and smiled. It's Friday evening. It’s time to rest. It’s time to go home.

## News:

  What happened last week:
  - Did you know that Callisto orbits around Jupiter exactly 82 times and [ManageIQ](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq) can do nothing about that.
  - Scientists discovered 99 new [animal species](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-ui-classic).
  - Honey badger can eat [One Openstack](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-providers-openstack), [Two Hawkulars](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-providers-hawkular), [Two VMWares](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-providers-vmware), [Two Amazons](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-providers-amazon), [One OVirt](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-providers-ovirt/) and [Two Lenovos](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-providers-lenovo) providers. After all of that, he can continue and eat [Twenty Ducks](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-ui-service). Are you surprised? He’s honey badger! Honey badger can eat whatever he want!

  And that's all from me.
