Vote for the E-Release!!!

We are closing in on the final Darga release.  So, itâ€™s time to think about how we will name the E Release.  In keeping with our nomenclature of using chess grandmasters and world champions as release names, here are the proposed names for the E Release:

- [Jaan Ehlvest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaan_Ehlvest)
- [Pavel Eljanov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Eljanov)
- [Max Euwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Euwe)
- [Larry Evans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Evans)

Vote [HERE](http://talk.manageiq.org/t/voting-on-name-of-e-release/1464/2) for your favorite by making a selection in the corresponding talk topic for this post! You are welcome to write in any player you want (as long as their last name starts with the letter E) by replying to the topic with your choice.  Here are the [top 100 active players](http://2700chess.com/?per-page=100) and [all grandmasters - past and present](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chess_grandmasters).
