ManageIQ is getting ready to release an alpha version of the Jansa release.  Additionally, we are moving to a faster release cadence - approximately once every 3 months to keep up with the rate of change of all the providers that ManageIQ interacts with.  We hope to release Jansa GA by June and the K-release by September.  You will notice new milestones in the ManageIQ community to help us keep track of the features being planned for a particular release.  The milestones and the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/ManageIQ/projects/13) should help keep us all on track!

At this point in time, we usually offer the community an opportunity to vote on the next release name.  An exception is being made to the name of the K-release to honor one of my all-time favorite world chess champions - [Garry Kasparov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Kasparov).  

As you can imagine, he broke many records.

- In 1984, at age 20, he became the top-rated player in the world.
- In 1985, at age 22, he became the youngest ever undisputed World Chess Champion by defeating Anatoly Karpov.
- From 1986 until 2005, Kasparov was ranked world No. 1 for 225 out of 228 months.
- In January 1990, Kasparov achieved the (then) highest FIDE rating ever, passing 2800 and breaking Bobby Fischer's old record of 2785.
- Kasparov holds the record for most consecutive professional tournament victories, placing first or equal first in 15 individual tournaments from 1981 to 1990.
- Kasparov won the Chess Oscar (player of the year) a record 11 times.

As a player, he also helped evolve computer chess.

- In 1985, Kasparov played against thirty-two different chess computers in Hamburg, winning all games, but with some difficulty.
- On October 22, 1989, Kasparov defeated the chess computer Deep Thought in both games of a two-game match.
- In December 1992, Kasparov played 37 blitz games against Fritz 2 winning 24, drawing 4 and losing 9.
- In 1995, during Kasparov's world title match with Viswanathan Anand, he unveiled an opening novelty that had been checked with a chess engine, an approach that would become increasingly common in subsequent years.
- Kasparov played in a pair of six-game chess matches with an IBM supercomputer called Deep Blue. The first match was played in Philadelphia in 1996 and won by Kasparov. The second was played in New York City in 1997 and won by Deep Blue. The 1997 match was the first defeat of a reigning world chess champion by a computer under tournament conditions.

An an author, he had an amazing influence on chess writing 3 multi-volume sets, among other books he wrote earlier.
