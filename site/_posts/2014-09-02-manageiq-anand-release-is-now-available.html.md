We're naming ManageIQ releases after chess grandmasters. Read about [Viswanathan Anand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viswanathan_Anand), this release's namesake.

One of the great things about launching new communities is all of the first landmarks and milestones reached in a short period of time:

- Due diligence of code - Check
- Developer workflow completed - Check
- First web site - Check
- First source code availability - Check
and...
- First GA community release - Check!
 - [Download ManageIQ Anand](http://manageiq.org/download)!

As of today, we can check off that last bullet with the release of [ManageIQ Anand](http://manageiq.org/download), the first open source GA release of ManageIQ. So what sort of features can you expect to see in this version?

- Supported providers: AWS, VMware VSphere, OpenStack, Microsoft SCVMM, RHEV/oVirt
- External auth (LDAP)
- Many, many fixes and rewrites to replace proprietary libraries in the older releases

This release represents the culmination of eight years of software development, starting in 2006, when a tiny startup named ManageIQ had some big ambitions. After the acquisition by Red Hat, the ManageIQ team faced a daunting task of rewriting significant pieces of code while making it open source-ready. It's been a great learning experience for everyone, and we now have a release that we can all be proud of.
