Dear ManageIQ community,

Today marks a new day in the 26-year history of Red Hat. IBM has finalized its [acquisition of Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/ibm-closes-landmark-acquisition-red-hat-34-billion-defines-open-hybrid-cloud-future), which will operate as a distinct unit within IBM moving forward.

What does this mean for Red Hat’s contributions to the ManageIQ project?

In short, nothing.

Red Hat will continue to be a champion for open source and projects like ManageIQ that have played such a large role in driving innovation in hybrid cloud management. IBM is committed to Red Hat’s independence and role in open source software communities so that we can continue this work without interruption or changes.

Our mission, governance, and objectives remain the same. Red Hat associates will continue to contribute to the upstream in the same ways they have been. And, as always, we will continue to help upstream projects be successful and contribute to welcoming new members and maintaining the project.

We will do this together, with the community, as we always have.

If you have questions or would like to learn more about today’s news, I encourage you to review the materials below. Red Hat CTO Chris Wright will host an online Q&A session in the coming days where you can ask questions you may have about what the acquisition means for Red Hat and our involvement in open source communities. Details will be announced on the [Red Hat blog](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog).
