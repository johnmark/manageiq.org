If you've been visiting [Planet ManageIQ](http://planet.manageiq.org/) recently, you know we've made some additions:

* [All Things Open](http://allthingsopen.com/) - James Labocki's blog covering lots of ground on open source cloud infrastructure software and cloud management in general
* [The Foreman Blog](http://blog.theforeman.org/) - With the Foreman integration being a big part of the upcoming Botvinnik release, we thought it would be good to keep up with what's happening on that project
* [Pulp Project Blog](http://www.pulpproject.org/blog/) - Pulp is an interesting project tied to the Foreman community with software for repository management 

These are in addition to the blog feeds already aggregated on Planet ManageIQ:

* [CloudFormsNow](http://cloudformsnow.com/) - John Hardy's power tutorials on CloudForms/ManageIQ
* [Ten Tenet.net](http://tentenet.net/) - Bryan Che's open hybrid cloud blog
* [Tender Lovemaking](http://tenderlovemaking.com/) - Aaron Patterson's blog on Ruby/Rails

Bookmark and enjoy!
