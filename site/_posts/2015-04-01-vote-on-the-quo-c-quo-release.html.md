As we get ever closer to the Botvinnik release, we turn our eyes to the next release cycle. In keeping with our nomenclature of [using chess grandmasters](/blog/2014/09/manageiq-anand-release-is-now-available/) and world champions as release names, we have a couple of candidates for the next cycle. Read about [Viswanathan Anand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viswanathan_Anand) and [Mikhail Botvinnik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Botvinnik) to see whom we chose for the "A" and "B" releases, respectively.

Here are the possible names for this release cycle:

* Capablanca - [José Raúl Capablanca](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ra%C3%BAl_Capablanca)
* Carlsen - [Magnus Carlsen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen)

Vote for your favorite below! Or if you want to nominate a "write-in" candidate, you're welcome to do that as well.
