For some time now, Booz Allen Hamilton, one of the founding members of the ManageIQ Community, has been hard at work on a "cloud broker". "What is a cloud broker," you may ask? It's a nice tool that allows individuals to pick and choose various service offerings from multiple sources, without knowing (or caring) which cloud or virtualization platform supplies the services. That they chose ManageIQ as the platform of record to build on speaks volumes to the hard work those engineers have put in over the last 8 years.

Today, [Booz Allen announced](http://www.boozallen.com/media-center/press-releases/2014/10/booz-allen-hamilton-open-sources-its-cloud-broker-project-to-red) the culmination of this work in the form of [Jellyfish](https://github.com/booz-allen-hamilton/projectjellyfish):

> Booz Allen Hamilton today announced that it has made its entire open source cloud broker project – which includes custom code, documentation, processes and best practices – publicly available via Booz Allen’s Github. The cloud broker project, codenamed “Project Jellyfish,” provides a framework and platform for organizations to act as internal or external brokers of cloud services. Project Jellyfish adds a layer of core broker-type functionality to cloud management, such as advanced catalog search and compare, project-based workflows, collaboration, dashboards, quotas and service blueprinting. Project Jellyfish leverages Red Hat’s cloud management platform, ManageIQ, with the goal of fostering open source collaboration and greater cloud management capabilities, thus enabling true “cloud first” and “open source first” initiatives amongst federal and commercial clients.

Look for more code and news to come from this nascent project.
