Yep, it's [syncrou](http://github.com/syncrou) here again for another entry in LWIMIQ.

If you're a typical reader of these entries, you'll know the drill by now. 
Essentially we like to feature a major enhancement, discuss what was improved, fixed, new
and finally what was deleted.

This week all of those will be covered, but in a slightly more efficient (lazier) 
method.
