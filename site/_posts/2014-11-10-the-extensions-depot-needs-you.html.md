We are happy to announce that we are moving forward with the ManageIQ Extensions Depot!  The Extensions Depot is a place for the ManageIQ Community to share policies, dialogs, state machines and other items of interest to the greater community. 

As we continue to work on the user interface for the Depot, we have begun pushing some of our extensions into the [Depot's GitHub repository. ](http://github.com/manageiq/manageiq_depot) There, you'll see instructions for how to format your extensions and how to generate a pull request to have it added to the repository. 

This is an exciting project. As we move forward with the depot UI, we will share that soon and look for your feedback. 

Thanks!
